    /// <summary>
    /// The sequencer has just one goal: define a complex sequence of engines to call. The sequence is not
    /// just "sequential", but can create branches and loops.
    /// With the time, I figure out that the majority of the times this class is useful in the rare cases where
    /// order execution of the engine is necessary/
    /// Using branching is even rarer, but still useful sometimes.
    /// I used loops only once.
    /// There is the chance that this class will become obsolete over the time, as by design engines should
    /// never rely on the order of execution
    /// Using this class to let engines from different EnginesRoot communicate will also become obsolete, as
    /// better solution will be implemented once I have the time
    /// Trying to work out how to initialize this structure can be painful. This is by design as this class must
    /// be initialized using the following pattern:
    ///    instancedSequence.SetSequence(
    ///                         new Steps //list of steps
